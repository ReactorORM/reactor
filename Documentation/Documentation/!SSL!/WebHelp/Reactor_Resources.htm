<h1>Reactor Resources</h1>

<p>As you're working with Reactor you're bound to run into areas where 
 you have questions or suggestions. &nbsp;There 
 are a few resources you can tap to help you with this: </p>

<h2>Reactor Mailing List</h2>

<p>The Reactor mailing list is the best place to get help with reactor. 
 At last count there were nearly 200 people subscribed. A number of people 
 have really stepped up to the plate to help people out and it's anticipated 
 that it will grow more over time. </p>

<h3>To Subscribe</h3>

<p>To subscribe to the reactor mailing list send an email to <a href="mailto:lists@doughughes.net">lists@doughughes.net</a>. 
 The subject of the message will be ignored. However, in your body add 
 the following text: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=code>subscribe reactor</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should receive a message confirming that you subscribed. </p>

<h3>To Unsubscribe</h3>

<p>To unsubscribe send a message to <a href="mailto:reactor@doughughes.net">reactor@doughughes.net</a> 
 with the word 'unsubscribe' in the subject. Alternatively, you can place 
 the following text in the body of your message: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=code>unsubscribe reactor</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should receive a message confirming that you were unsubscribed.</p>

<h3>Sending Messages</h3>

<p>To send messages to the list email <a href="mailto:reactor@reactorframework.com">reactor@reactorframework.com</a> 
 (or <a href="mailto:reactor@doughughes.net">reactor@doughughes.net</a>). 
 </p>

<h2>Reactor Trac Website</h2>

<p>Trac is a popular project management tool that integrates nicely with 
 Trac. <a href="http://www.simb.net/">Simeon Bateman</a> was kind enough 
 to donate hosting for both Trac and Subversion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Trac site is located at <a href="http://trac.reactorframework.com">http://trac.reactorframework.com</a> 
 and can be used to learn more about Reactor, to track the progress of 
 the project, and to submit bug reports and feature requests.</p>

<h2>DougHughes.net</h2>

<p>Doug Hughes is the primary developer of Reactor. &nbsp;His 
 blog, located at <a href="http://www.doughughes.net">http://www.doughughes.net</a>, 
 frequently covers topics related to Reactor. &nbsp;In 
 particular look at the <a href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm?filter=category&amp;categoryId=30">Reactor 
 category</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually a Reactor section will be added to this site.</p>

<h3>Don't Contact Doug Directly</h3>

<p>Please don't try to contact Doug Hughes directly. &nbsp;He's 
 a single developer who is running his own consulting company and trying 
 to have a life outside of work too. &nbsp;In 
 a nutshell, he's busy. &nbsp;Please, 
 if you need help send a message to the Reactor mailing list.</p>

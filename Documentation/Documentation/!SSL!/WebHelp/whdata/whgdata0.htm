 aGE("Active Record","The Active Record design pattern is new to many developers but has become familiar due to well recognized and respected implementations including the Ruby on Rails framework.  There are many flavors of this design pattern.  Most implementations are of one object which represents one row in a database.  The object has assessors and mutators (methods for getting and setting values) as well as methods for reading a record, saving it, and deleting it.  There are also frequently methods for accessing related objects in the database.");

<h1>Record Objects</h1>

<p>Now that we know how to query for data, you'll probably want to know 
 how to load, save and delete individual rows. &nbsp;To 
 do this you will use Record Objects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Record Object is an object which represents one row in the database. 
 &nbsp;At the 
 risk of using too much technical jargon, Record Objects are, in many ways, 
 Beans objects which also implement the Active Record design pattern.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before we get too far, let's define what a &quot;Bean&quot; is. &nbsp;A 
 Bean is traditionally a component which encapsulates its instance data 
 in private properties. &nbsp;It 
 then provided &quot;getters and setters&quot; (assessors and mutators, 
 technically) which are used to read and write those values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you get all that? &nbsp;I'll 
 simplify it a bit, just in case: Our User table has six fields. &nbsp;When 
 we create a Record object it will have six pairs of methods for reading 
 and setting the values of those fields. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, one field is username. &nbsp;So, 
 we'll have a method <span class=function>getUsername()</span> which returns 
 the username. &nbsp;We'll 
 also have a method called <span class=function>setUsername(username)</span> 
 which accepts a username and sets the value within the object. &nbsp;If 
 you pass &quot;Doug&quot; into <span class=function>setUsername()</span>, 
 subsequent calls to <span class=function>getUsername()</span> will return 
 Doug.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditionally, a bean only has getters and setters and nothing more. 
 &nbsp;However, 
 I also said that the Record objects implemented the Active Record design 
 pattern. &nbsp;This 
 really means that Record objects know how to persist themselves to the 
 database.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=note>Note: There are a few interpretations of the Active Record 
 design pattern. &nbsp;This 
 is not exactly the same as the implementation in Ruby on Rails!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To facilitate this, the Record objects have three important methods: 
 <span class=function>load()</span>, <span class=function>save()</span> 
 and <span class=function>delete()</span>. &nbsp;They 
 are very descriptive of what they do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suspect that by now you want to know how to <a href="Read_a_Record.htm">Read 
 a Record</a>.</p>

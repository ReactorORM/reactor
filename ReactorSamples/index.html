<h1>  Important! </h1>
<p>For any of the sample applications to work out-of-the box you will need to create a mapping named &quot;/ReactorSamples&quot; which points to this directory.</p>
<p>Also - See the readme in each of the application's folders before running the app. They need to be configured correctly. </p>
<h2>Samples:</h2>
<p><strong>Contact Manager</strong> - This is a simple example which was inspired by the Mach-II and Model-Glue Contact Manager application. This application follows a traditional CF model with one file handling the data access, display and postbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Blog</strong> - This is a simple blog application built using  the Model-Glue framework with Reactor. This was heavily influenced by Ray Camden's work. </p>
